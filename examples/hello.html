	<h1>The Beauty of HTTP</h1>

	<p>HTTP, the protocol that we use to browse</p>
	<p>Its beauty and complexity, few really know</p>
	<p>It starts with a request, a GET or a POST</p>
	<p>Sent from the browser, to the server host</p>

	<p>The server replies with a response code</p>
	<p>200 means OK, 404's a dead end road</p>
	<p>Content-Type header tells what's in the response</p>
	<p>HTML, JSON or CSS, it's all in the sentence</p>

	<p>HTTP, a protocol that's always evolving</p>
	<p>New versions and features, always revolving</p>
	<p>But its beauty lies in its simplicity and ease</p>
	<p>Without it, the web would be hard to please</p>

	<p>So let's give thanks to HTTP, our unsung hero</p>
	<p>For bringing the world wide web, with all its kilobytes and zeros.</p>
